Beneath The Massacre â€“ Lithium Overdose

Wretched
Fatally wounded
Save me from myself
A tormented mind that nothing can appease
A stain on our conscience
A tormented mind now running on empty
A stain on our conscience
A stain on our conscience
Help me find my way back to healing
Take me to your artificial paradise
Feed me the lies I'm dying to hear
I need this illusion to make it through
Wretched
Fatally wounded
Save me from myself
I need a shoulder to rest my head on
Bring me serenity so I can close my eyes; close my eyes on this world
Take me to your artificial paradise
I need an illusion to hide my insanity
Give me, give me the strength I need to carry on
The strength to carry on
Wretched
Fatally wounded
Save me from myself
A tormented mind that nothing can appease
A stain on our conscience
A tormented mind now running on empty
A stain on our conscience
A stain on our conscience
Save me... 
Save me... 
Save me... 
Save me... 
I can stare at the enemy in the mirror's reflection
I can stare at the enemy in the mirror's reflection
I can stare at the enemy in the mirror's reflection
I can stare at the enemy in the mirror's reflection
