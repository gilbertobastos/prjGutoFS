Suffocation - Humam Waste

Death corrodes all hope meant for the mindless ones. 
Crippled by the treachery imbedded by me. 
Lead into the caverns of the evil ones. 
Bleeding through that echos your screams. 
Sink into my pits of hate. 
Ashes of the dead recremate. 
God has turned his back on you, we leave no human waste. 
Summon now my wings of hate suffocate. 
Christened by hate, face now crippled by emotions. 
Abandonment of your god has caused insanity. 
Unstable minds snap as you begin to rip yourself apart. 
Nailed to the bones that once structured your dear family. 
The crucifiers march to begin the closing of the sky. 
Left in a void that is to be, left here to die in this world. 
Now is a game, to be dead the restitution.
